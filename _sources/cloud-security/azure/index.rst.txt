Using Cyb3rhq to monitor Microsoft Azure
======================================

This section provides instructions for monitoring `Microsoft Azure` infrastructures, such as:

- Monitoring instances by installing the Cyb3rhq agent on them. This will send events to the Cyb3rhq manager for analysis in order to classify the events within a range of alerts that can be easily viewed.
- Monitoring the Azure Portal and its services, including platform logs from Azure services, logs, performance data from virtual machines, and usage and performance data from the applications.
- Monitoring the Microsoft Entra ID (ME-ID) activity to discover how the Microsoft Entra ID services are accessed and used.
