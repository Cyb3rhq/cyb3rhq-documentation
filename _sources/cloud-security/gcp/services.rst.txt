Monitoring Google Cloud services
=================================

Cyb3rhq provides modules that integrate with the Google Cloud Pub/Sub and Google Cloud Storage bucket services. Pub/Sub is a Google Cloud messaging service that allows communications between independent applications while Cloud Storage is a managed service that allows you to store and distribute your data in Google Cloud.  The Cyb3rhq modules for monitoring Google Cloud fetches different events such as data access, privileged activities, system events, and DNS queries from your Google Cloud infrastructure.

These log collection and analysis capabilities allow organizations that rely on Google Cloud Platform for their infrastructure, providing them with the ability to proactively monitor activities and respond effectively to security incidents within their cloud environment.
