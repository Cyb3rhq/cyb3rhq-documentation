Monitoring Google Cloud instances
=================================

You can install the Cyb3rhq agent directly on Google Cloud virtual machines or instances for Linux, Windows, and macOS operating systems. Once installed, Cyb3rhq agents collect security data from the monitored endpoints and transmit it to the Cyb3rhq server for analysis. Security protection is applied to the monitored endpoints based on the analysis and the detected events.

Check the :doc:`Cyb3rhq agent installation </installation-guide/cyb3rhq-agent/index>` and :doc:`enrollment </user-manual/agent/agent-enrollment/index>` documentation to learn more about the Cyb3rhq agents. Additionally, read about Cyb3rhq SIEM and XDR capabilities and their configuration in our :doc:`capabilities </user-manual/capabilities/index>` documentation.
