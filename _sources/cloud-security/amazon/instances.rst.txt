Monitoring AWS instances
========================

Installing the Cyb3rhq agent on the AWS EC2 instances provides information and monitoring about what's going on inside of them.

The agent runs as a service on the instance and collects different types of system and application data that forwards to the Cyb3rhq manager through an encrypted and authenticated channel.

Thanks to the Cyb3rhq agent, there are some capabilities available to monitor the instances:

- :doc:`Log data collection </user-manual/capabilities/log-data-collection/index>`
- :doc:`File integrity monitoring </user-manual/capabilities/file-integrity/index>`
- :doc:`/user-manual/capabilities/malware-detection/index`
- :doc:`Security policy monitoring </user-manual/capabilities/policy-monitoring/index>`
- :doc:`System inventory </user-manual/capabilities/system-inventory/index>`
- :doc:`Vulnerability detection </user-manual/capabilities/vulnerability-detection/index>`

To learn more about the different Cyb3rhq capabilities, check out :doc:`this section </user-manual/index>`.

.. note::
  To install the Cyb3rhq agent, follow the instructions available in the :doc:`agent installation guide </installation-guide/cyb3rhq-agent/index>`.
