Default rules
=============

Cyb3rhq default rules are the built-in rules that come with the Cyb3rhq installation. They are available at ``/var/ossec/ruleset/rules/`` on the Cyb3rhq server. These rules cover a wide range of security events and log sources, providing a baseline for common security threats. Default rules are designed to detect various types of attacks, vulnerabilities, or suspicious activities. They are continuously updated and maintained by the Cyb3rhq team to address emerging threats and ensure the effectiveness of the security detection capabilities.
