   :title: Global App loading logo
   :alt: Global App loading logo
   :align: center
   :width: 80%

#. Edit ``opensearch_dashboards.yml``. You can find this file in the following locations:

   -  ``/etc/cyb3rhq-dashboard/``
   -  ``/usr/share/cyb3rhq-dashboard/config/`` for Docker installations.

#. Add the URL of your default and dark theme logos.

   .. code-block:: yaml
      :emphasize-lines: 2-4

      opensearchDashboards.branding:
         loadingLogo:
            defaultUrl: "https://domain.org/default-logo.png"
            darkModeUrl: "https://domain.org/dark-mode-logo.png"
