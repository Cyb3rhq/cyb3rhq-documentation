Cyb3rhq agent
===========

The Cyb3rhq agent is a multi-platform component of the Cyb3rhq solution and runs on the endpoints you want to monitor. It communicates with the Cyb3rhq server, sending data in near real-time through an encrypted and authenticated channel. The Cyb3rhq agent provides capabilities such as log data collection, file integrity monitoring, threat detection, security configuration assessment, system inventory, vulnerability detection, and incident response to enhance your endpoint security.

After installing the Cyb3rhq agent on an endpoint, you need to enroll the Cyb3rhq agent in the Cyb3rhq manager. This guide provides instructions on how to enroll the Cyb3rhq agent, the different enrollment methods, and the management of the Cyb3rhq agent.

The Cyb3rhq agent enrollment section describes the stages a Cyb3rhq agent can go through and the process of enrolling Cyb3rhq agents in a Cyb3rhq manager. You can also find troubleshooting steps for commonly encountered issues during enrollment.

In the Cyb3rhq agent management section, you can find instructions on how to manage the Cyb3rhq agent. These instructions cover administrative tasks such as upgrading the Cyb3rhq agent, verifying connection to the Cyb3rhq manager, and querying the Cyb3rhq agent configuration.
