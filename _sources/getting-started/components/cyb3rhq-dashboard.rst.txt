Cyb3rhq dashboard
===============

The Cyb3rhq dashboard is a flexible and intuitive web user interface for mining, analyzing, and visualizing security events and alerts data. It is also used for the management and monitoring of the Cyb3rhq platform. Additionally, it provides features for role-based access control (RBAC) and single sign-on (SSO).

Data visualization and analysis
-------------------------------

The web interface helps users navigate through the different types of data collected by the Cyb3rhq agent, as well as the security alerts generated by the Cyb3rhq server. Users can also generate reports and create custom visualizations and dashboards.

As an example, Cyb3rhq provides out-of-the-box dashboards for regulatory compliance such as PCI DSS, GDPR, HIPAA, and NIST 800-53. It also provides an interface to navigate through the MITRE ATT&CK framework and related alerts.

Agents monitoring and configuration
-----------------------------------

The Cyb3rhq dashboard allows users to manage agents configuration and to monitor their status. As an example, for each monitored endpoint, users can define what agent modules will be enabled, what log files will be read, what files will be monitored for integrity changes, or what configuration checks will be performed.

Platform management
-------------------

The Cyb3rhq dashboard provides a user interface dedicated to manage your Cyb3rhq deployment. This includes monitoring the status, logs, and statistics of the different Cyb3rhq components. It also includes configuring the Cyb3rhq server, and creating custom rules and decoders for log analysis and threat detection.

Developer tools
---------------

The Cyb3rhq dashboard includes a Ruleset Test tool that can process log messages to check how it is decoded and if it matches a threat detection rule or not. This feature is especially useful when custom decoders and rules have been created and the user wants to test them.

The Cyb3rhq dashboard also includes an API console for users to interact with the Cyb3rhq API. This can be used to manage the Cyb3rhq deployment (e.g., managing server or agent configurations, monitor status and log messages, adding or removing agents, etc.).
