Creating a backup
=================

This guide explains how to create a backup of your Cyb3rhq files, such as logs, and configurations. Backing up Cyb3rhq files is useful when migrating your Cyb3rhq installation to a different system.

The :doc:`../restoring/index` documentation provides a guide to restore a backup of your Cyb3rhq central components and Cyb3rhq agent files.
