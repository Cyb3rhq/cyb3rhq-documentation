Using Cyb3rhq for PCI DSS compliance
==================================

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a proprietary information security standard for organizations that handle credit cards. The standard was created to increase controls around cardholder data to reduce credit card fraud.

Cyb3rhq helps ensure PCI DSS compliance by performing log collection, file integrity checking, configuration assessment, intrusion detection, real-time alerting, and active response. The Cyb3rhq dashboard displays information in real-time, allowing filtering by different types of alert fields, including compliance controls. We have also developed a couple of PCI DSS dashboards for convenient viewing of relevant alerts. The syntax used for tagging PCI DSS relevant rules is ``pci_dss_`` followed by the number of the requirement (e.g., ``pci_dss_10.2.4`` and ``pci_dss_10.2.5``).

This guide explains how Cyb3rhq capabilities and modules assist with meeting **PCI DSS version 4.0** requirements:

In the following sections, we show some use cases on how to use Cyb3rhq capabilities and modules to meet **PCI DSS version 4.0** requirements:
