   :description: Cyb3rhq can be integrated with several Identity Providers (IdP) to implement Single Sign-On (SSO). Learn more about it in this section of the Cyb3rhq documentation.

Single sign-on
==============

Cyb3rhq supports the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) standard for Single Sign-On (SSO) in addition to the internal user database used for authentication. This allows organizations to use their existing Identity Providers (IdP) to manage access to the Cyb3rhq platform.

Learn how to create administrator and read-only roles on several IdP and map them with Cyb3rhq in the sections below.
