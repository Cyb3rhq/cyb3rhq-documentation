Rootcheck
=========

Since Cyb3rhq v3.9.0, the new :ref:`SCA module <manual_sec_config_assessment>` replaces *Rootcheck* when performing policy monitoring.

Cyb3rhq monitors configuration files to ensure they are compliant with your security policies, standards, or hardening guides. Agents perform periodic scans to detect applications that are known to be vulnerable, unpatched, or misconfigured.
