The Cyb3rhq module for AWS (``aws-s3``) provides capabilities to monitor AWS based services. Each of the sections below contains detailed instructions to configure and set up all of the supported services, and also the required Cyb3rhq configuration to collect the logs.

This module requires dependencies in order to work, and also the right credentials in order to access the services. Take a look at the :doc:`Amazon prerequisites </cloud-security/amazon/services/prerequisites/index>` section before proceeding.
