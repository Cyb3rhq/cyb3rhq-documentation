Cloud Console

The Cyb3rhq Cloud Console provides web-based access to manage your Cyb3rhq Cloud environments.

.. _cloud_glossary_cloud_id:

Cloud ID
--------

The Cloud ID is a unique ID for your environment on Cyb3rhq Cloud. It is used for multiple purposes, such as Cyb3rhq WUI access or the agent registration process.

.. _cloud_glossary_environment:

Environment
-----------

An environment is a deployment that contains all the Cyb3rhq components ready to use and running on Cyb3rhq Cloud.

.. _cloud_glossary_archive_data:

Archive data
----------------------------------------------

Formerly known as cold storage, it's the data containing the output generated by Cyb3rhq, such as alerts and archives. It's an AWS S3 bucket to store your logs for a longer time and meet compliance requirements.

.. _cloud_glossary_hot_storage:

Indexed data
--------------------------------------------

Formerly known as hot storage, it's the data available on the Cyb3rhq dashboard corresponding to the information indexed by Cyb3rhq. This information is available as soon as Cyb3rhq ingests and indexes the events sent by the agents, making the data searchable and analyzable.

Indexed data is calculated using the primary shards of ``cyb3rhq-*`` indices.

.. _cloud_glossary_tier:

Tier
----

The concept of a tier, which represents the size limitation, in bytes, of the indexed data (formerly known as hot storage), is no longer used. It has been replaced by the *indexed data capacity* setting.

.. _cloud_glossary_setting:

Setting
-------

In the context of Cyb3rhq Cloud, a setting  refers to each configuration option available for a cloud environment. These settings determine the limitations, functionalities, and pricing of an environment.

.. _cloud_glossary_profile:

Profile
-------

A profile refers to predefined settings that you can choose from when configuring your Cyb3rhq Cloud environment. We have three profiles available: Small, Medium, and Large. These profiles are designed to simplify the process by providing preconfigured settings that cater to different needs and requirements. If none of the predefined profiles meet your specific requirements, you can configure your settings individually.

.. _cloud_glossary_region:

Region
------

A region is a geographic area where the data center of the cloud provider that hosts your environment is located. The region you select cannot be changed after you create an environment. If you are not sure what to pick, choose a region that is geographically close to you to reduce latency.

Available regions:

* North Virginia: ``us-east-1``
  
* Ohio: ``us-east-2``

* London: ``eu-west-2``

* Frankfurt: ``eu-central-1``
