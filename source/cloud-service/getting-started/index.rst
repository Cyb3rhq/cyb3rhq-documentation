Getting started
===============

A Cyb3rhq Cloud environment is a deployment that contains all the Cyb3rhq components ready to be used. To get started with Cyb3rhq Cloud, you need to create a Cyb3rhq Cloud account and set up your environment. 

The installation and update of the Cyb3rhq components and defining scalability are all handled by the Cyb3rhq Cloud. Once your environment is ready, you must access the Cyb3rhq dashboard and deploy the Cyb3rhq agent to your endpoints.
