You can configure the integration with |service| either in the Cyb3rhq manager or in a Cyb3rhq agent. This choice depends solely on how you access your |service| infrastructure in your environment.

You only need to install dependencies when configuring the integration with |service| in a Cyb3rhq agent. The Cyb3rhq manager already includes all the necessary dependencies.
